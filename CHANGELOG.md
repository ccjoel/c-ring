Unreleased

Added

 - Webpack, gulp, and other dependencies

TODO

- use regex to validate input (from api or textarea), so that if format is not followed we throw error
- change size on browser resize
- do something about the overlapping nodes, to distinguish them better
- maybe style app better?
- maybe allow a configuration file, in which you specify the size of the nodes in the cluster ring, colors, etc.
